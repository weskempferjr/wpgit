After wizard goes to sleep, steal the spell book and then put those brooms to work!

### Break down into end to end tests

I will certainly have a break down of some sort. 

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

Do I have to explain everything?

That is the goal. 

## Built With

* The accummulated work of millions of amazing people.

You have better things to do. This is just for testing at this point.
